    <p><br>My name is V.Aravind Reddy. I am currently persuin my masters degree in OK. I am the elder child in my family. I have one younger brother . My mum is a full time housewife and my dad is a electrical engineer.
    I have every intention of applying to a reputable university and obtaining a degree in one of these fields. I am responsible and hardworking, so I study hard to obtain good grades.
    This is not to say that I don’t love all the care and attention. I do, it’s just that sometimes it can get stifling. However, I am quite content with my life.
    I love meeting people and I love making friends with people who are social. I am who I am, and I make no excuses for how I have turned out.</br></p>
